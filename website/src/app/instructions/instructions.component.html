      <h1 class="mb-4">How to use Morphic</h1>
      <p class="text-muted">June 15, 2025</p>

<h2 class="mb-3">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Morphic was developed as a tool to answer ecological questions as part of a study by Leighton et al. (2016).
  <br><br>
  Morphic is provided as-is with no guarantees, but if you run into problems we may be able to help:

<p>
  Morphic is a tool that helps you analyze images it captures from Google Images. To use Morphic, you first need to determine what information you need from the images. To gather this information, you create a survey that will be filled out once for each of the images Morphic has captured.
</p>

<h3 class="mb-3">1. Create a survey</h3>
<p>
  The first step in using Morphic is to create a short relevant survey to fill out per image. This survey will capture the required information to answer your question.
  <br><br>
  You need to name your survey, and you can optionally add a descriptive comment which will be displayed next to the name to help you tell surveys apart.
</p>

<h3 class="mb-3">2. Add search results to the survey</h3>
<p>
  Now that you have a survey, you need to gather some images from Google Images. To do this, you 'Add search' on the 'Searches' tab of the survey. Morphic will perform a real image search on your behalf.
</p>

<h3 class="mb-3">3. Fill out the survey</h3>
<p>
  Now that you have images associated with your survey, you can begin to analyze them by navigating to the 'Search Results' tab.
</p>

<h3 class="mb-3">4. Exporting the raw data</h3>
<p>
  Exporting your data is the last step. Once you're satisfied, go to the 'Export Results' tab and click the 'Export Results' button.
