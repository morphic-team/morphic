<p><b>Search Queries:</b> We retain the search queries you input for gathering images from Google Images.</p>
<p><b>Session Data:</b> We store session information in your browser's local storage to keep you signed in between visits.</p>

<h2 class="mb-3">3. How We Use the Information</h2>
<p><b>User Accounts:</b> To authenticate you and associate your surveys and data with your account.</p>

<h2 class="mb-3">7. External Links</h2>
<p>Morphic may link to other websites, like Google Images or the Chrome Web Store, which have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.</p>
